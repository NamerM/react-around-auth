## SPRINT 14 PROJECT LOG

This is the project we entered the back end world, communicationg with server side.
For our project we had used Node.js , Express.js together

## Tools utilized
We cloned the project we first set sailed to Front-End with React. Around-react, this time we used it as a canvas & with built in Eslint controller coded the components.


## Project
The project requires us to add authorization & registration features. Used the server running on [https://register.nomoreparties.co](https://register.nomoreparties.co/ for all of the authoziation, registration and token requests.


## Project Tech: REACT, JSX, Api
Routing is what we implemented aside with API features to fetch, get & post the tokens from the server.
App.js has new functions for registration, login and logout together with authorization(checktoken) logic. All of the Api requests described in the App.js

  ## REACT: Hooks & UseState & UseEffect
  Api requests are done with useEffect, hook usage. Functions included the useState parameters to set state and process the requests.

  ## JSX
  Components coded with JSX

  ## JWT: Jason Web Token
  The data Posted and created stored in the server and accessed by fetch token feature, we also stored the JWT's in the browser with localStorage.setItem() command.

  ## CSS
  Used Css techniques to match the Figma layout and arrange the forms and inputs.

  ## Status Messages and Responses
  In each route file where we want to reach data we have server responses.
  fs.promises used together with 'res' command.
  Also we set Status with res.status(###) also .catch responses etc.

## After words
As we are nearing the end of the Alumni Programme pieces are slowly coming together. We had Front-End and Back-End working together with our current project, not only we fetch the data from the server we can & add data to the server. By storing Tokens on server we can access the userData and also save them as tokens in the browser so we can authenticate users on our website.
